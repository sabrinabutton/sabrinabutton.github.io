This included attaching LiDAR to the Otter via a meticulously crafted 3D printed mount. I designed and fabricated four distinct 3D printed components to enhance the Otter's performance and adapt it for specific tasks. Additionally, I played a pivotal role in the wiring and concept development of a payload hardware box. This comprehensive unit incorporated an ethernet switch, power board, Jetson Orin, and radio components, optimizing the Otter's hardware for advanced functionalities.","Another significant milestone in this journey involved programming a Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) driver package tailored to interface seamlessly with the Otter USV's proprietary hardware. This effort included the creation of five custom data types, streamlining control, and enabling data reception, including GPS, IMU, power metrics, and odometry data generated by a Kalman filter. This ROS2 integration elevated the Otter's capabilities and paved the way for advanced control and data analysis.","The most groundbreaking achievement was the development and publication of a pioneering particle-filter-based global localization algorithm, specifically designed for the Maritime Robotics Otter USV. This algorithm proved invaluable for accurate localization in GPS-denied environments, achieving up to 20 meters of global accuracy. Leveraging satellite imagery and LiDAR data, the algorithm employs a unique approach. It simulates LiDAR scans of the shoreline by raycasting on regional satellite imagery from random locations, comparing these simulated scans with real LiDAR point clouds to generate precise estimates of the Otter's position. This innovative algorithm adapts the scan matching step of a traditional particle filter to USV localization challenges, significantly enhancing the Otter's navigational capabilities.","These endeavors culminated in comprehensive in-water testing, conducted across four distinct locations in Kingston and Minden, Ontario. These tests underscored the practical impact of our work, validating the Otter's enhanced capabilities in various real-world scenarios. These projects collectively demonstrate my commitment to advancing autonomous marine technology and my capacity to deliver tangible results in complex, real-world environments."],embed:[],imgs:[{src:"https://i.imgur.com/O9p8jia.jpg",size:"500px"},{src:"https://i.imgur.com/ivFebMj.jpg",size:"500px"}],soft_skills:["Collaboration, Live Project Demonstration, Iterative design, Collecting Requirements, Research and Development"],tech:["ROS2, C++, Python, LiDAR, 3D Printing, OpenCV, Git, Linux,  Particle Filters"],more:!0,header:"Robotics"},{size:250,title:"CO2 Monitoring Lynx Rover",ref:"lynx-rover",blurb:["A four-wheeled autonomous rover was modded with the primary objective of generating a heat-map illustrating CO2 concentration levels across a LiDAR SLAM-generated floorplan.

Three distinct models were devised to meet the client's specifications, all featuring a cylindrical body, sieve, funnel, and soil sample pathway leading to cuvettes for wet chemical biosignature testing. The chosen design prioritized simplicity and effectiveness, employing a manually operated sieve and a clever distribution system. This fully non-electric apparatus, designed with a focus on user-friendliness, efficiently grinds soil samples, distributes them evenly, and facilitates varied cuvette placement for testing. The selection of this design was based on its minimized points of failure, cost-effectiveness, and lightweight construction, although it may be less adept at grinding coarse grains compared to designs with electric motor-driven sieves.
