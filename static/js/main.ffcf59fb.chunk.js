This project was extremely beneficial to my teamwork skills, improved my abilities to collect and implement requirements by a client, and ignited my passion for integrated mechanical design.","The following excerpt is from the executive summary of the final report of this project.","Queen\u2019s Space Engineering Team (QSET) requires a chemical testing apparatus for laboratory use, which can detect signs of life, or biosignatures, in soil samples. QSET annually designs a rover with a payload to conduct chemical testing on soil samples in a simulated mars exploration competition. This test apparatus is required since QSET is interested in testing wet chemical tests in the fall semester; however, QSET presently cannot do so until the winter semester, when the payload for the rover is built. The chemical testing apparatus proposed in this report is thus purely for lab use.","Three models have been generated to meet the required functionality [for] the client. All three models consist of a cylindrical body, sieve, funnel, and a pathway for soil samples to travel into cuvettes, where wet chemical biosignature tests will occur. The first model consists of a manually operated sieve and no electrical components and a radial arrangement of tubes about a conical separator to deliver the soil sample to cuvettes. The second contains a vibrational sieve, which feeds soil onto a valve attached to an actuator, which drops soil onto a rotating plate of cuvettes when a weight threshold is met. The third utilizes a sieve that rotates around an axis and contains ball bearings to crush samples, which are then fed directly into cuvettes. Designs were evaluated based on their simplicity, versatility, sieve effectiveness, ability to be cleaned, cost, and weight. The team selected the first design as the lack of electric parts in this design minimizes points of failure and makes the design cost-effective and lightweight. However, this design will be less capable of grinding coarse grains than those with electric motor-driven sieves.","The following describes the chosen design as taken from the \u2018Design Solution\u2019 section of the final report.","The proposed design solution is a fully non-electric testing apparatus which prioritizes simplicity, ease of use, and the effectiveness of the design\u2019s sieve.  This design features a simple user-operated sieve. The sieve contains two grinding stars, one stacked on another, the bottom of which moves to grind soil samples when a wire, which is connected to a trigger, is pulled. Crushed soil then falls through the sieve mesh below into the funnel to the distributor. The soil sample is then funnelled onto a cylindrical cone, which distributes the soil sample evenly into nine tubes in radial arrangement around the cone. Nylon tubes inserted into this distributor through the bottom of the holes will extend down to cuvettes; each cuvette will have a cubic plastic attachment. The cuvettes are embedded in a shelf with a matrix of grooves to allow for varied placement of the cuvettes."],embed:[],imgs:[{src:"https://i.imgur.com/WkFxC4L.png"},{src:"https://i.imgur.com/cextWLq.jpg"}],soft_skills:["Teamwork"],tech:["SolidWorks Protoyping, Mathematical Modeling"],more:!0},{size:500,title:"ReCoin, UofT Hacks IX 3rd Overall Winner",blurb:["This app was developed in 36 hours by myself and three friends as our submission to UofT Hack IX. The theme of the hackathon was \u2018restoration\u2019, specifically referring to the restoration of small businesses following the pandemic. Our team took the prompt a step further, and decided to make environmental restoration an additional outcome of our product. We came up with ReCoin, a mobile app that can be used to scan waste, direct a user to the correct drop site for the waste, and through a rewards system, direct users to partnered small businesses to spend their \u2018ReCoins\u2019.","The following blurb describes the app more technically and is sourced from the project\u2019s DevPost.","This intuitive app utilizes an image-classification neural network to identify waste captured by the user's camera. The user will then be alerted of nearby drop sites for their recyclable product at partnered local businesses, where they can take their scanned product and exchange it for credit. The goal of Recoin is to strengthen engagement with small businesses while raising public consciousness about the lifecycle of waste. Reduce, Reuse, Recoin. ","In Pytorch, we utilized an open-source trash detection AI software and data, to train the trash detection system originally developed by IamAbhinav03. The system utilizes over 2500 images to train, test, and validate the system. To improve the system, we increased the number of epochs to 8 rather than 5 (number of passes the training system has completed). This allowed the accuracy to increase by 4% more than the original system. We also modified the test/train ratio and split amounts to 70%, 10%, and 20% respectively, as more prominent AI studies have found this distribution to receive the best results. ","Currently, the system is predicted to have a 94% accuracy, but in the future, we plan on using reinforcement learning in our beta testing to continuously improve our algorithm. Reinforcement learning allows for the data to be more accurate, through learning from user correction. This will allow AI to become more precise as it gains more popularity. ","A flask server is used to make contact with the waste detection neural network; an image is sent from the front end as a post request, the Flask server generates a tensor and runs that through the neural net, then sends the response from the algorithm back to the front end. This response is the classification of the waste as either cardboard, glass, plastic, metal, paper or trash."],embed:[{src:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3cQccg12dgQ"}],imgs:[{src:"https://i.imgur.com/qZ9qrZb.png"}],soft_skills:["Teamwork"],tech:["Flask, Javascript, PyTorch, Expo"],more:!0}],u=[{size:100,title:"Ciena | Automation Software Engineer Intern",blurb:["Refactored automation code to improve efficiency in product testing and future test development.","Developed an internal notification system for product test results."],embed:[],imgs:[],soft_skills:["Collecting Requirements, Professional Communications"],tech:["Python, Linux, Hardware Testing, Test Automation"],more:!1},{size:100,title:"Ciena | FOS Chamber Development and Integration Intern",blurb:["Developed and integrated an automated controller and sensor-monitor for a flowers-of-sulfur test chamber for printed circuit boards using an Arduino-based system.","Collected requirements from electrical, chemical, and mechanical engineers to create controller and GUI","Developed an affiliated graphical user interface to allow for remote control of the chamber via a lab PC connected to the controller\u2019s serial port."],embed:[],imgs:[],soft_skills:["Teamwork, Iterative design"],tech:["Arduino, C, Mechanical-prototyping, React JS, analog, digital, and PWM electronic hardware"],more:!1},{size:100,title:"Kinaxis | Software Developer Intern",blurb:["Developed a portion of the company website using an API to better the Kinaxis recruiting system.","Developed bots for Microsoft Teams to improve company productivity by integrating a notification system for the company\u2019s technologies into the chatbots."],embed:[],imgs:[],soft_skills:["Live Project Demonstration, Professional Communications"],tech:["React, Javascript, Node JS, APIs, Node.js, Azure, Git"],more:!1}];function p(){var e=f;return e.minHeight=80,e.maxHeight=300,Object(r.jsxs)("div",{class:"container",children:[Object(r.jsxs)("div",{class:"blurb",children:[Object(r.jsx)(o.a.h1,{initial:{opacity:0},animate:{opacity:1},transition:{duration:2},children:"Sabrina Button"}),Object(r.jsx)(o.a.h2,{initial:{opacity:0},animate:{opacity:1},transition:{duration:2},children:"Mechatronics and Robotics Engineering Student at Queen's University"}),Object(r.jsx)(o.a.img,{initial:{height:"150px",margin:"7em"},animate:{scale:2},transition:{duration:3},whileHover:{scale:2.3},class:"myface",src:l,alt:"Logo"})]}),Object(r.jsx)("div",{class:"blurb",children:Object(r.jsxs)(d.a,{options:f,children:["Hi!
